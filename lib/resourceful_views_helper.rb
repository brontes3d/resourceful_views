module ResourcefulViewsHelper

  # Calling content_for_object stores a block of markup in an identifier for later use.
  # You can make subsequent calls to the stored content in other templates or the layout
  # by passing the identifier as an argument to <tt>get_content_for_object</tt>.
  # 
  # ==== Example
  # 
  #   <% content_for_object(:listing_each) do | user | %>
  #     <li>User <%=user.name%> is a <%=user.role%></li>
  #   <% end %>
  # 
  # You can then use <tt>get_content_for_object :listing_each</tt> anywhere in your templates.
  #
  #   <ul>
  #   <% current_objects.each do |object| %>
  #     <%=get_content_for_object(:listing_each, object)%>
  #   <% end %>
  #   </ul>
  #
  # The rails way of accessing a content_for_block (either via <tt>yield :listing_each</tt> or via <tt>@listing_each</tt>)
  # will not work with content_for_object. (because of course, we need a way pass it an argument. 
  # That's the +object+ in +content_for_object+)
  def content_for_object(view, &block)
    @content_for_object_blocks ||= {}
    @content_for_object_blocks[view.to_sym] ||= []
    @content_for_object_blocks[view.to_sym] << block
  end
  
  # see also: +content_for_object+
  #
  # In addition for being the only way to retrieve content blocks declared with +content_for_object+,
  # this method can also retrieve content defined partials in either the folder for the current controller, 
  # or in the 'default' folder.
  # 
  # If asked to <tt>get_content_for_object(:listing_each, object)</tt> and we come from UsersController
  # * 1st we look for partials named _listing_each_defaults.* and execute them (not render)
  # * 2nd we look for previously defined calls to <tt>content_for_object(:listing_each)</tt>
  # If none are found:
  # * 3rd we look for file: /users/_listing_each.*
  # If not found: (and a theme is defined, for example 'admin')
  # * 4th we look for file: /themes/admin/_listing_each.*
  # If not found:
  # * 5th we look for file: /default/_listing_each.*
  #
  # In some cases, there may be multiple declarations of <tt>content_for_object(:listing_each)</tt> in contenxt
  # In which case, all of them will be called by <tt>get_content_for_object(:listing_each, object)</tt>

  # Retrieves any previous declaration of <tt>content_for(view)</tt> and and calls it with the prefered rails mechanism:
  # <tt>yield view.to_sym</tt>.
  #
  # If there was *NO* previous definition of <tt>content_for</tt> matching the +view+ param, 
  # then we set the content provided in the block as the content, and then yield (render it)
  #
  # I debated making a version of this method that would only store default content and not retrieve it, 
  # but I think this is the more common case.
  # 
  # This implementation of default_content_for is closely tied to the implementation details of how content_for is implemented in rails
  #
  # ==== Example
  # 
  # In /default/index.html.erb I might write
  #
  #   <% default_content_for(:title) do %>
  #     <h1><%= current_model.to_s.underscore.pluralize.humanize %></h1>
  #   <% end %>
  # 
  # And then I have a nice default implementation of a title on all my pages
  # 
  # But then just for the Users views I want a _different_ title, so:
  #
  # In /users/_index_defaults.html.erb I might write
  #   
  #   <% content_for(:title) do %>
  #     <h1>This is the index page for the users</h1>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # So when the action +index+ is called on +UsersController+ I will end up rendering /defautl/index.html.erb as the view
  # But first, /users/_index_defaults.html.erb will be executed, which won't output anything, but will set a content_for(:title)
  # meaning that the call to <tt>default_content_for(:title)</tt> will spit out this Users specific title, while all my other calls
  # will still use the content defined in the block given to +default_content_for+
  #  
  def default_content_for(view, &block)
    if get_content_for(view).blank?
      # puts "content blank"
      eval "@content_for_#{view.to_s} = capture(&block)"
    end
    # puts "yielding #{view}, content should be " + eval("@content_for_#{view.to_s}").inspect
    concat(eval("yield :#{view.to_s}", block.binding), block.binding)
  end
    
  # Basically the equivalent of 
  #    <%=yield :thing%>
  # assuming you have previously defined
  #     content_for(:thing) do
  #       ...
  #     end
  # Except, get_content_for goes the extra distance of searching more places in order to fulfill your content request
  # 
  # First, we execure 'defaults' for the requested content.  This means if you were asking for the content_for 'fields'
  # Then we're going to look for and run the first '_fields_defaults' partial we can find, and execute it, 
  # because it might define <tt>content_for(:fields)</tt> or at least something that has an affect on it.
  #
  # Next, we check if <tt>content_for(:fields)</tt> has been defined, and if so, we return that content.
  #
  # If not, then we'll look for a partial '_fields' in the appropriate order 
  # (current controller, current theme, default folder).
  # If we find such a partial, we render it and return it's contents.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # If asked to <tt>get_content_for(:listing)</tt> and we come from UsersController
  # * 1st we look for partials named _listing_defaults.* and execute them (not render)
  # * 2nd we look for previously defined calls to <tt>content_for(:listing)</tt>
  # If none are found:
  # * 3rd we look for file: /users/_listing.*
  # If not found: (and a theme is defined, for example 'admin')
  # * 4th we look for file: /themes/admin/_listing.*
  # If not found:
  # * 5th we look for file: /default/_listing.*
